# Recursive Koch Polygon Generator 
## Overview
  This program uses Python’s turtle graphics and recursion to generate a geometric pattern based on the Koch curve.
  Instead of a single line, each side of a polygon is recursively modified to create an inward-pointing Koch indentation.
  The user can control:
 
  •	The number of sides of the starting polygon
 
  •	The length of each side

  •	The recursion depth (how many times the Koch indentation recurs)
